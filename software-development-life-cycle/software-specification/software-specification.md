### data structures, algorithms, and methods needed to implement or prepare
1. unsorted array based list
2. unsorted linked list
3. sorted array based list
4. sorted array based list
5. binary search tree
6. prepare a data file to store strings (requirements say size should be up to 100, then let it be 100 specifically)
7. implement a file reader program to help us read data from file into a array based list
8. implement a file reader program to help us read data from file into a linked list
9. sequential search for 4 list implementations and using count basic operations and time consumption to evaluate the time complexity of each data structures
10. use binary search algorithm to search on sorted array
11. use BST to search the same data
12. create a random number generator to generate 2000 random numbers
13. based on generated numbers reiterate the search algorithms above and compute the data complexity.
14. we should specify the Big-O complexity of each data structure and search algorithm

### user interface
1. provide a menu to select each algorithm and data structure
2. easily run all options
3. when a list is created, print out the list content
4. use command line input/output interface first
5. if we have time, implement the GUI one
